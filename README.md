## Jets Project

### Week 3 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
The week three assignment was to create a fleet of jets, with the ability to give those jets different capabilities. All jets have a model name, speed, price, and range, but certain jets also had the ability to dogfight or carry cargo. The user also needed the option to add and remove jets from the list of jets from the virtual hanger.

### Technologies/Topics Applied
During this assignment, I made extensive use of lists, abstract classes, abstract methods, interfaces, and reading files.

### Lessons Learned
It was tough dealing with the need to pass the Scanner and list around multiple methods. Keeping the parameters and return types straight in my head was crucial. Also, I had to figure out when I could use the "instanceof" operator to get methods to be called only on certain objects in my loops. Overall, no one thing in particular tripped me up that much; it was a struggle dealing with applying a little bit of everything I've learned so far.
